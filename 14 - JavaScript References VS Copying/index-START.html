      const x = 5;
      let y = x;
      y++;
      console.log({ x, y }); //5,6
      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const p2 = players;
      p2.push('test');
      console.log(players.length, p2.length); //5/5

      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      const p3 = [...players];
      players.push('test2');
      console.log(players.length, p3.length); //6,5

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      // or use the new ES6 Spread

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80,
        address: {
          country: 'UK',
          city: 'Manchester',
        },
      };

      // and think we make a copy:

      // how do we take a copy instead?

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      // NEW way of deep copy in JS
      const person2 = structuredClone(person);
      person.address.city = 'Liverpool';
      console.log(person.address.city, '<-->', person2.address.city);

      const objectWithFun = { myFun: () => console.log('first') };
      structuredClone(objectWithFun); //ERR
